# Task 1: what to do in theory 
# script for loading different exe files for changing world environment: 
# this should be a function that iterates through a series of perhaps 20 different lighting changes and make
# sure that you look into the possibility of different lighting intensities as well 

# Task 2: what to do in theory
# change camera angles: work with translation and rotation by entering the coordinates to stay within 
# create a for loop for iterating through the camera angles and rotations: perhaps make this the main body of 
# code within which you iterate through the other steps 

# Step for 2: 
# Step 1: pool dimensions to stay within 
# Step 2: iterate through a triple for loop for translation and rotation
# Step 3: create the rest of the code within the body of this for loop because the process needs to repeat 
# with different camera positions within the pool


#Step 3
# once we've generated a set of different values that the camera can abide by then
